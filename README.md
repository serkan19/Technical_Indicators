## Integrating Technical Indicators

## Moving Average (MA)

The MA — or ‘simple moving average’ (SMA) — is an indicator accustomed to determine the direction of a current market trend, while not interfering with shorter-term market spikes. The moving average indicator combines market points of a selected instrument over a particular timeframe and divides it by the number of timeframe points to present us the direction of a trend line.

The data used depends on the length of the MA. For instance, a two hundred MA needs 200 days of historical information. By exploiting the MA indicator, you’ll be able to study levels of support and resistance and see previous price action (the history of the market). This implies you’ll be able to determine possible future price patterns.

## Bollinger Bands

A Bollinger Band is a technical analysis tool outlined by a group of trend lines with calculated 2 standard deviations (positively and negatively) far from a straightforward moving average (SMA) of a market's value, however which may be adjusted to user preferences.

Bollinger Bands were developed and copyrighted by notable technical day trader John Bollinger and designed to get opportunities that could offer investors a better likelihood of properly identifying market conditions (oversold or overbought).

Bollinger Bands are a highly popular technique. Many traders believe the closer the prices move to the upper band, the more overbought the market is, and the closer the prices move to the lower band, the more oversold the market is. 

## Parabolic Stop and Reverse (Parabolic SAR)

The parabolic SAR is a widely used technical indicator to determine market direction, but at the same moment to draw attention to it once the market direction is changing. This indicator also can be called the “stop and reversal system,” the parabolic SAR was developed by J. Welles Wilder Junior. — the creator of the relative strength index (RSI).

On a chart, the indicator seems like a series of dots placed either higher than or below the candlestick bars. A dot below the candlestick is deemed to be an optimistic bullish signal. Conversely, a dot above the price is used to illustrate that the bears are in control and that the momentum is likely to remain downward. When the dots flip, it indicates that a possible change in asset direction is possible. As an example, if the dots are above the candlestick price, and then they appear below the price, it could signal about change in market trend.

As the price of the market rises, the dots will rise as well, first slowly and then picking up speed and accelerating with the trend. The SAR dots start to move a little quicker as the trend goes up until the dots catch up to the market price.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is known as a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the correlation between 2 moving averages of a market’s price. Default MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

As a result of this mentioned calculation, we receive the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD is referred to as the “signal line,” which is plotted on top of the MACD line, which might operate as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may do a buy order once the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell — or short — the security once the MACD crosses below the signal line. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are often interpreted in several ways, however the most common methods are divergences, crossovers, and fast rises/falls.

    MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA;
    MACD triggers technical signals once it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line;
    The speed of crossovers is additionally taken as an indication of a market is overbought or oversold;
    MACD helps investors perceive whether or not the optimistic or pessimistic movement within the price is strengthening or weakening.

There is a lot of ways how MACD can help us while doing market orders. Differently from before mentioned indicators, MACD will be plotted to volume subplot, because it has different ranges while calculated and we can’t plot in the price subplot.
